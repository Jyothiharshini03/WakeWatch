Spill-to-vessel attribution.

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
This module correlates model outputs -- a segmented spill from the SAR net,
per-ping anomaly flags from the AIS autoencoder, and (by default) a backward
drift hindcast from `drift.py` -- against a common place and time, and ranks
the vessels that could account for the slick.

Two entry points:

  * `attribute_from_observation()` -- the recommended default. Hindcasts the
    slick back to its estimated release point and time (`drift.hindcast`),
    then reconstructs and scores AIS traffic around that *origin* window, not
    the point where the satellite happened to see the oil. This is the literal
    reading of the problem statement's step (c): "reconstruct vessel traffic
    around the origin window in space and time."

  * `attribute()` -- the lower-level primitive. Scores vessels directly
    against a given lat/lon/time with no hindcasting. Still useful when the
    slick is known to be fresh (minimal drift), when an analyst wants to
    manually override the estimated origin, or as a fallback if the hindcast
    itself fails. `attribute_from_observation` calls this internally.

The hindcast is a physics-based drift model with an honestly-reported
uncertainty radius (see `drift.py`), not a guarantee: a slick's true origin
can still fall outside the estimated point, especially far from shore or after
many hours adrift. `drift_caveat` carries this to the operator on every
result rather than burying it in docs.

The ranking itself is a transparent weighted sum of four measurable
quantities, not a learned model. Every component is returned alongside the
total so an analyst can see precisely why a vessel ranked where it did, and
disagree with it.
