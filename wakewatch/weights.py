"""
Weight resolution for hosted deployments.

Two failure modes bite when this project leaves a laptop, and both produce
confusing errors far from their cause:

1. **Unresolved LFS pointers.** `best_sar_model.pth` is 105 MB and must travel
   through Git LFS. Platforms that clone without LFS support (Streamlit
   Community Cloud among them) leave a ~130-byte text stub on disk with the
   right filename. `torch.load` then fails with an opaque unpickling error.
   We detect the stub and say plainly what happened.

2. **Weights deliberately kept out of the repo.** Set `WAKEWATCH_WEIGHTS_REPO`
   to a Hugging Face Hub repo id and missing files are fetched at first use,
   which lets the same code deploy anywhere without a 105 MB blob in git.

When the files are simply present and valid -- the normal local case -- every
function here is a cheap stat() and nothing else happens.
